## File extension

Why am I using long file extensions?

*"We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive
file extensions. It’s sad that all our operating systems rely on this stupid
convention instead of the better creator code or a metadata model, but great
that they now support longer file extensions."*

*"…the only file extension I would endorse is “.markdown”, for the same reason
offered by Hilton Lipschitz"*
